    <string name="shortstory">My name is Christian Franc M. Carvajal. My current role in life is the eldest brother with two brothers. My ultimate goal is to build something beneficial to society.  It may not be just one thing, but a combination of things. I have not precisely pinpointed what I would like to make. Still, I guess that gives me the freedom to explore more technologies before settling on a problem and crafting a solution for it. As a junior developer with still a lot to learn, that is my end goal, and it is what motivates me to improve myself as a developer.</string>
